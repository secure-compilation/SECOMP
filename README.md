## Overview

This repository contains the SECOMP formally secure compiler.

## Requirements

This development is built and tested with Coq 8.15.2. It is based on the 64-bit
RISC-V backend of CompCert 3.12.

General requirements:

 - OCaml version 4.5.0 or greater (OCaml 5 is not supported).

 - Coq version 8.15.2 (OPAM package: `coq`)

 - Menhir version 20190626 or greater (OPAM package: `menhir`).

System requirements can be verified through CompCert's `configure` script
(see below).

Together with the above, the toolchain relies on the riscv64 architecture
version of the GCC compiler, available for example from the
`gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu` package on Debian-based systems.

Extended requirements for systematic testing:

 - OCaml version 4.14.0 or greater.

 - QCheck (OPAM package: `qcheck`).

 - MenhirLib (OPAM package: `menhirLib`).

## Structure

The development is currently split into four branches, which we are working on
merging into a single release:

 - `ccs-submission`: compiler correctness proof and testing infrastructure (main)

 - `backtranslation`: proof of back-translation

 - `recomp-ccs`: proof of recomposition

 - `secure-compilation`: proof of blame

## Building

Each branch can be built after installing its dependencies by configuring the
CompCert build process, e.g., by going to that folder and running:
```
./configure -toolprefix "riscv64-linux-gnu-" rv64-linux
```
where `riscv64-linuxâ€“gnu-` stands for the prefix used by the local RISC-V
compilation chain.

One can then compile the project by running `make` (optionally with the `-j` command line argument).
The command `make proof` can also be used to only check the proofs.

## Main branch: `ccs-submission`

This branch contains the extension of CompCert to compartments, which involved
updating the languages, passes, and correctness proofs. This extension can be
built into a compiler binary that can be used to compile compartmentalized C
programs that can be executed. It also includes the systematic testing
infrastructure employed to validate the assumptions and expected behavior of the
back-translation function.

The updated correctness proof is complete and can be
found in file `driver/Compiler.v`, theorems
`transf_c_program_correct` and `separate_transf_c_program_correct`, and only
depends on CompCert's existing axioms, and similar axioms regarding compartments.
To verify this, uncomment and execute `Print Assumptions transf_c_program_correct` and
`Print Assumptions separate_transf_c_program_correct`. This will load and print the list
of axiomatised results used in the proofs.

The following files include the most interesting changes:
 - Compartment model: file `common/AST.v`, modules `COMPTYPE` and `COMP`.
 - The notion of interface can be found in `common/Globalenvs.v` and is named
 `Policy`. The same file describes how we check for allowed calls.
 - Events: file `common/Events.v`, inductive `event`. The same file contains
 the buffer-based IO development and the detailed models for the `read` and
 `write` system calls.

### Examples

Compartmentalized program examples can be found under `test/compartments`.

### Testing the compilation of the back-translation

The property-based testing infrastructure for Assumption 1 can be found under
`test/backtranslation`.

After compiling CompCert, from the testing folder, run:
```
touch .depend
make clean
make depend
make test_backtranslation
```

Running the `test_backtranslation` binary performs the testing.

## Back-translation branch: `backtranslation`

This branch contains the back-translation proof. Use `make proof` to replay the proof.

The proof is complete. This proof is done in a slightly more complex setting
where system calls can belong to particular compartments. Also some recent
changes to the mainline `ccs-submission` branch are in the process of being
integrated.

The memory deltas are defined in the file `security/MemoryDelta.v`.

The informative events (called `bundled_events`), and the intermediate language
characterizing the well-formedness of informative traces (`ir_step`) are defined
in `security/BtAsm.v`. The proof going from RISC-V assembly to the intermediate
language is called `asm_to_ir`.

The `security/Backtranslation.v` contains the implementation of the
back-translation function, `gen_program`.

The `security/BacktranslationProof.v` contains the proof of correctness of the
back-translation, starting from the intermediate language: `ir_to_clight`.

The `security/BacktranslationProof2.v` contains the complete proof from assembly
to Clight: `backtranslation_proof`.

## Recomposition branch: `recomp-ccs`

This branch contains the recomposition proof. Use `make proof` to replay the proof.

The proof is mostly complete and most of the main `correctness` branch has been
merged. Compared to the main correctness branch, this branch contains fixes to
the way programs access arguments stored on the stack. The recomposition proof
is modified to account for these changes.

File `common/Smallstep.v` contains the definition of the three-way simulation
relation (`tsim_properties`), and the proof that it implies preservation
of finite prefixes (`tsimulation_star`). The same file also contains the
simulation diagrams depicted in Section 6 (`Section THREEWAY_SIMU_DIAGRAM`).

File `security/Recomposition.v` contains the proof of recomposition: lemma `simulation`,
as well as the three cores lemmas used to instantiate the diagrams:
`step_E0_strong`, `step_E0_weak`, and `step_t`.
The simulation invariants can be found at `strong_equivalence`, `weak_equivalence`, `stack_rel`.

There are some low-level lemmas admitted, that we are in the process of fixing:
- `set_perm_preserves_rel` states that a new `set_perm` operation, that we use
  in the enforcement mechanism to protect the stack, respects the invariants.
- `eval_builtin_arg_inject` is used to prove the preservation of the arguments
  to system calls. The similar result `extcall_arguments_preserved` is fully proved.
- `step_t` contains some admits that are the symmetric cases of other proved goals.

## Blame branch: `secure-compilation`

This branch contains the blame proof. Use `make proof` to replay the proof.

The proof is complete. Some recent changes to the mainline `ccs-submission`
branch are in the process of being integrated.

The main blame theorem can be found in file `security/Blame.v`, theorem
`does_prefix_star`.

Definition 6 (Blame) can be found in file `security/Blame.v`, theorem
`blame_program`.

- This follows directly from `does_prefix_star` and uses a simple technical
  lemma that is to be proved after integration on the mainline `ccs-submission`
  branch.

- Theorem `blame` is a simple corollary that matches the one used in the
  top-level security proof.

Full program run lemmas: file `security/Blame.v`, theorems `parallel_exec` and
`parallel_exec'`.

Synchronized execution lemmas: file `security/Blame.v`, theorems `parallel_star_E0`
and `parallel_exec1`.

Stepwise lemmas: file `security/Blame.v`, theorems `parallel_concrete` and
`parallel_abstract_t`.

### Capability backend

Our prototype implementation of the capability-based backend and secure calling
convention is found under `cheririscV/`.

Simple compilation examples are in file `cheririscV/CapAsmgen.v`, section
`Examples`.

The compiler binary is instrumented to produce capability assembly in addition
to regular compartmentalized CompCert assembly.
