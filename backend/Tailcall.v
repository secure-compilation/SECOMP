(** Recognition of tail calls. *)

Require Import Coqlib Maps AST Registers Op RTL Conventions.

(** An [Icall] instruction that stores its result in register [rreg]
  can be turned into a tail call if:
- its successor is a [Ireturn None] or [Ireturn (Some rreg)] instruction;
- the stack block of the current function is empty: [stacksize = 0].

If the current function had a non-empty stack block, it could be that
the called function accesses it, for instance if a pointer into the
stack block is passed as an argument.  In this case, it would be
semantically incorrect to deallocate the stack block before the call,
as [Itailcall] does.  Therefore, the optimization can only be performed if
the stack block of the current function is empty, in which case it makes
no semantic difference to deallocate it before or after the call.

Another complication is that the [Ireturn] instruction does not, in general,
follow immediately the [Icall] instruction: the RTL code generator
can have inserted moves and no-ops between these instructions.
The general pattern we recognize is therefore:
<<
       r1 <- call(....)
       nop
       r2 <- r1
       r3 <- r2
       return r3
>>
The [is_return] function below recognizes this pattern.

(** Tailcalls between compartments are not allowed.  The [ce: compenv]

  constant. *)

(** The code transformation is straightforward: call instructions
  followed by an appropriate nop/move/return sequence become
  tail calls; other instructions are unchanged.

  To ensure that the resulting RTL code is well typed, we
  restrict the transformation to the cases where a tail call is
  allowed by the calling conventions, and where the result signatures
  match. *)
